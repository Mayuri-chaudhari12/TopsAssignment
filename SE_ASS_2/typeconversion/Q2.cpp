// Objective: Practice type casting in C++.

/*
In C++, type casting refers to converting one data type to another. There are two main types of casting:

1. Implicit Type Casting (Automatic Type Conversion): Performed by the compiler automatically 
when converting a smaller data type to a larger one, or when thereâ€™s no risk of data loss.
   
2. Explicit Type Casting (Manual Type Conversion): Done by the programmer using casting operators like `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, and `const_cast`.

### Types of Casts in C++:
- `static_cast`: Used for simple type conversions (e.g., from `float` to `int`).
- `dynamic_cast`: Used for safe conversions, typically used in object-oriented programming when converting between related class types.
- `reinterpret_cast`: Performs low-level reinterpretation of bit patterns.
- `const_cast`: Used to add or remove the `const` qualifier from a variable.
